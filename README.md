My GitHub repo for tracking my planned 1.12.2 faithful (and maybe spiritual) successor to the famous 1.6.4 TPPI modpack. This pack was the first popular pack to be focused around "balance". With a focus of "If one mod does XYZ, dont add mods that do X or Y" there is an emphasis on removing redundancy with any mods that are added. 

The plan is "If i want to do A, I need to look at my mods that can do AB, CD, EF, GH options" instead of having overlap with mod options "AB, BC, BD, BE, DF, DG, GH" 

Planned to do:
* Clean up repo, add tasks/sprints for this to do list, 
* set up MultiMC env.
* do a 1:1 copy of TPPI/TPPI2 mods into a 1.12.2 instance 
* Get Crafttweaker working for 1.6.4 TPPI Tweaks replicated


Maybe to do:
* Recreate TPPI-tweaks mod in 1.12.2 (Named VK-Tweaks)
* Look at popular 1.8 - 1.12.2 mods to add to VKPI
